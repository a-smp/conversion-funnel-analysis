# Conversion Funnel Optimization | ShopNexus

## Objective
Analyze user drop-offs in the conversion funnel and test page optimizations through A/B experiments to improve engagement, reduce friction, and increase completed purchases.

## Business Problem

The ShopNexus e-commerce site experiences high drop-off rates across the funnel, with **87%+ of users leaving before reaching the cart page**. Even among those who initiate checkout, **76.4% abandon their cart**, indicating friction in the billing process.

üí° **How can we turn more visitors into paying customers?**\
This project aimed to increase conversions by testing two key optimizations:

1Ô∏è‚É£ A new landing page to improve engagement.\
2Ô∏è‚É£ A new billing page to streamline checkout.

## Schema & Analytical Framework

This analysis defines the funnel stages as:\

- Conversion Rate
- Bounce Rate
- Cart Abandonment Rate (CAR)
- Clickthrough Rate (or drop-off rate)
- Session Duration
- Pages per Session

### Dimensions

- Device Type
- New/Returning Users



## Key Findings

![CleanShot 2025-03-05 at 18 05 45@2x](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb7d0beb-7790-475e-8c1e-a7c74631ca4a)

- **The new billing page significantly improved conversions**, increasing the billing-to-order conversion rate by 14%, confirming that a simpler checkout experience reduces friction and leads to more completed purchases.
- **The new landing page had a minor positive effect, reducing bounce rate by 5%** and slightly increasing engagement, but **it did not drive a meaningful increase in conversions**.
- **The highest-performing test group** (Old Landing Page + New Billing Page) **achieved a 3.5% conversion rate**, while the **lowest-performing group** (New Landing Page + Old Billing Page) **converted at just 2%**, indicating that **the landing page update may have negatively impacted performance**.
- Overall, **sitewide conversion rate dropped to 2.4%** (a 20% decline from the 3% baseline), mainly because **traffic was distributed more heavily toward lower-performing test groups**.

**If the best-performing test variation (Old Landing Page + New Billing Page) were applied sitewide, the estimated impact would be:**

‚úÖ **+416 additional conversions**\
‚úÖ **~$20,800 in additional revenue (assuming an AOV of $49.99)**

## Next Steps
‚úî Launch the new billing page sitewide to capture more completed orders.\
‚úî Refine the landing page instead of fully replacing it.\
‚úî Optimize mobile UX to improve conversion rates.\
‚úî Refocus paid search targeting to attract higher-intent users.\
‚úî Continue checkout optimizations to further reduce cart abandonment.
